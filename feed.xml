<description>We had the chance to handle the vivo X300 Pro at the launch of the X300 series in China, but the phone is now at the office and in for a proper review.

We can also put it side by side with its predecessor, which reveals a few differences. Most notably, the new phone is  smaller in all dimensions.




The vivo X300 Pro, right, and the X200 Pro on the right

A key difference is in the displays. The X300 Pro has a flat-edged screen, whereas the X200 Pro has a slight curve to its display. The vivo faithfuls here at HQ are unsure whether they like their old, slightly curved screen or the...</description>

<description>Redmi is making the K90 Pro Max official on October 23, and ahead of that it showed us the phone's design a few days ago. Today, the brand has decided to also reveal its key specs.

Let's start with the battery, because it's massive: 7,560 mAh. It supports 100W wired, 50W wireless, and 22.5W reverse wired charging, and is even advertised to be fully compatible with 100W PPS chargers.

<title>Here's when the Huawei Mate 80 series is rumored to launch</title>
<link>https://www.gsmarena.com/heres_when_the_huawei_mate_80_series_is_rumored_to_launch-news-69984.php</link>
<description>Huawei's Mate 80 series could be announced as soon as November, according to a new rumor from Digital Chat Station on Weibo. That may still change and the launch could slip into December, but for now November seems to be the plan.

The Mate 80 will allegedly be available in black, white, and turquoise. Interestingly, the Mate 80 phones will be joined at their launch event by a "2-in-1 tablet", though it's not clear at all what that means.

<title>Xiaomi 17 Pro Max in for review</title>
<link>https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_17_pro_max_in_for_review-news-69982.php</link>
<description>The iPhone 17 Pro Max had just about 1 month of being able to call itself the best Pro Max around! The Xiaomi 17 Pro Max may be a corny namestealer, but it's about as serious on the specs front as you can get.

What immediately grabs the attention is the rear screen, so let's talk about it. It's absolutely top notch - a 120 Hz LTPO OLED panel  with a peak brightness of 3,500 nits.

On the software side, the rear screen isn't very useful. It technically supports third-party apps, but only Chinese ones are allowed for now. Hardly surprising, since the phone is only available in China and...</description>
